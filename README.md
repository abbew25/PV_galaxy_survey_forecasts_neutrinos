# Forecasting constraints for neutrino mass with peculiar velocity surveys

## About
This repository contains code to produce Fisher information forecasts for galaxy surveys to constrain the sum of neutrino masses. The code allows you to produce forecasts for surveys with redshift information, peculiar velocity information, or a survey that has both.

This code is heavily inspired by/based off the code here: https://github.com/CullanHowlett/PV_fisher

## Technologies required

This code was created with Python 3 (3.7.6). You will need to also install the CLASS package, see instructions at https://lesgourg.github.io/class_public/class.html.
Other python packages required used include: scipy, numpy, pandas, os, time, pickle, matplotlib.
